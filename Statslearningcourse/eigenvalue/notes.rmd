# Overview

* Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are numbers and vectors associated
to square matrices, and together they provide the eigen-decomposition
of a matrix which analyzes the structure of this matrix

* simple expression for correlation/covariance matrices
    * Eigendecomposition used to find max or min of functions
        * e.g. eigendecomposition of a covaraince matrix = least squares est of original matrix
        * used in PCA
        
$Au = \lambda u$
where

$$A = matrix \\
\lambda = eigenvalue \\
u = Eigenvector$$



What is a cross product matrix?
