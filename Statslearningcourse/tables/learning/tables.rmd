This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


|            |     | Sepal.Length |      | Sepal.Width |      |
|------------|-----|--------------|------|-------------|------|
| Species    | n   | mean         | sd   | mean        | sd   |
| setosa     | 50  | 5.01         | 0.35 | 3.43        | 0.38 |
| versicolor | 50  | 5.94         | 0.52 | 2.77        | 0.31 |
| virginica  | 50  | 6.59         | 0.64 | 2.97        | 0.32 |
| All        | 150 | 5.84         | 0.83 | 3.06        | 0.44 |


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
