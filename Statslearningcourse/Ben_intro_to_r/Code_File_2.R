#############################

# plotting in the base R environment is cumbersome

# ggplot2 streamlines plotting code and has a universal syntax across all it's functions (the arguments that work for one function 
# from ggplot2 work for all of it's functions - not the case for base graphics plotting functions)

# ggplot2 can generate it's own legends - (legends can be time consuming and fiddly in base graphics, especially if you want them 
# outside the plotting box)

# ggplot2 can plot with transparency - not something base graphics can not do

# writing extensively about 'ggplot2' is largely redundant given the excellent book by the package author:
#   H. Wickham. ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis. Springer New   York, 2009.
# and his similarly excellent website:  http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/

# so I'll confine myself here to whetting your appetite for this package with a few examples of it's many features and capabilities

# (in case you are wondering what the 'gg' stands for: ggplot2 is based on 'The Grammar of Graphics' (Wilkinson 2005))

# library(ggplot2) #load package 'ggplot2'

 # the dataframe diamonds comes with 'ggplot2'

dim(diamonds) # and it's quite large ( 53940 rows and 10 columns i.e.  53940 observations of ten variables)

head(diamonds)

summary(diamonds) # summary statistics for numeric variables in 'diamonds', numbers of observations at each factor levels for variables that are factors

qplot(carat,price,data = diamonds) # qplot is the high level, easier to use function, it's name stands for 
# 'quick plot'

# there is also the lower level ggplot() function which qplot() calls

dsmall <-  diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds),100),] # taking a random sample of 100 of these rows
# to make a smaller dataframe 

#qplot can map a factor to point colour, shape or size

qplot(carat,price,data = dsmall, colour = color) # note the automatic legend reflects the name of the variable mapped to colour and it's actual factor levels

levels(dsmall$color)

qplot(carat,price,data = dsmall, shape = cut)

levels(dsmall$cut)

# plot point colour, shape, size are all aesthetic attributes which can have a variable mapped to them 
# with a scale function

#ggplot2 will create a scale function by itself

#scale functions may also be overwritten e.g. here to plot all points as 'red'

qplot(carat,price,data = dsmall, shape = cut,colour = I('red')) # the I() protects the value 'red' 
# forcing ggplot2 to use it for each point

# we could achieve the same effect by binding an additional column consisting purely of the word 
# 'red' to the data and mapping this column to point colour like so

dsmall <- data.frame(dsmall,new.col=rep('red',nrow(dsmall)))

qplot(carat,price,data = dsmall, shape = cut,colour = new.col)

# we can also set a single transparency value for all data to get a feeling for just how much overlap there 
# is in the data
qplot(carat,price,data = diamonds, colour = I('red'),alpha=I(1/100)) # alpha=I(1/100) means that if 100 
# points overlap the plot there will be opaque black 
# above is the plotting with the 'points' geometry (qplot guesses which geom to use based on the data) 
# these may also be set and there are lots of possibles see:  http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/

#for instance:

#interesting alternative to boxplots
qplot(cut,price/carat,data = diamonds, geom = 'jitter', alpha = I(1/40))

# quick p.d.f. estimates
qplot(carat,data=diamonds,geom = 'density') # overall fit for probability density function for all the 
# carat values of all data

#mapping categorical variables to an aesthetic will automatically divide and plot the data accordingly e.g.

qplot(carat,data=diamonds,geom = 'density' ,colour = cut) # gives one density for carat values for each grouping of the data by 'cut' quality
#or 
qplot(carat,data=diamonds,geom = 'density' ,linetype = cut) # gives one density for carat values for each grouping of the data by 'cut' quality

# faceting making panels of figures
#just map the variable you want to facet by to facets e.g.
qplot(price/carat, data=diamonds,facets= color~., geom= 'histogram') # creating panels of plots is called 
# faceting and is very efficient to code compared to doing this in base graphics

qplot(price/carat, data=diamonds,facets= color ~ cut, geom= 'density') # map interactions of variables to 
# facets with '~' to produce two way panels displaying plots for all groups of the data formed by 
# combinations of the two factors

# Plotting confidence intervals around model predictions as semi-transparent bands

# (would work equally well with any other estimate of variability around some trend line)

# Here we apply this method to plotting the confidence intervals around the different model predictions 
# the model selection exercise from Code File 1 (BRAG_Intro_to_R.R)

# first we generate the data

# Now the plotting of these data with ggplot2 

# this is somewhat inelegant - ggplot2 is difficult to use when the data you want plot are spread across 
# multiple dataframes as they are here

# however it is possible - if you have better way to achieve the same plot please get in touch :)

# the variables mapped to the aesthetics must be present in both dataframe with the same range of values 
# (this is why I bind a column of 0s to the dataframe 'Data' and call it 'Fit', 
# it already shares columns 'x','y' and 'f' with the dataframe 'Preds.m2.m6')

# ggplot2 expects groups to be defined by rows

# so rather than having separate columns for y1, y2 and y3 we need them all in the one column (one after 
# the other) differentiated by the values in another index column (my 'Fit' column below), with the data in 
# this format aesthetics (line type, colour etc.) may be set by mapping particular variables (columns) to 
# that aesthetic
