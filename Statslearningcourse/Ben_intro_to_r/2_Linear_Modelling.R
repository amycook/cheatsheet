# Hello and welcome to the code file to accompany Module II of this course.
# You will notice this code file is a lot less heavily annotated than that from
# the first module.
# If you get confuse try looking at the page for the function on the line that
# confuses you.
# To view a help page for a function simply type a  ? followed by the function
# name (with no space in between) at the terminal and execute this command.
# For example to view the help page for the lm( ) command execute the following

?lm

# This module requires R packages 'ggplot2' and 'rgl' so if you have not already
# please install these packages (you will be prompted to choose a CRAN mirror
# from which to download them - naturally your computer will need to be
# connected to the internet):

install.packages('ggplot2')

install.packages('rgl')

# Once the packages are installed you will be able to load them into memory (and
# thus make the functions they contain available for use) with the library( )
# command:

library('ggplot2')
library('rgl')

# ggplot2 has a great documentation website http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/
# with lots of example and pictures of the types of graphs different commands
# will create.

# This Module will focus modelling the data in the file names
# 'Multiple_Regression_Data.csv' which is available on the GitHub repository.
# If you downloaded and unzipped the entire repository (or indeed if you
# cloned it) the file will be at the following file path:
# ~/Intro_to_R/Data/Linear_Modelling/Multiple_Regression_Data.csv
# where the ~ represents the file path to the location of the Intro_to_R
# directory on your hard drive.

# To Read in these data navigate to and Select the
# 'Multiple_Regression_Data.csv' file in the dialogue box the that executing
# the following command opens:

Data <- read.csv(file = file.choose())

# This same take may also be accomplished by setting the working directory to
# wherever on you harddrive you saved the course files:

setwd('~/Intro_to_R/Data/Linear_Modelling/')

# then  executing
Data <- read.csv(file = 'Multiple_Regression_Data.csv')

# View a summary of the data

summary(Data)

# Plot the observations dependent variable 'y' against the observations of the
# first independent variable 'x1'
 
p1 <- ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = y), data = Data)
p1

# Note the error as we have yet to request anything be drawn having only set
# the coordinate systems
# to produce a scatter plot use the 'points' geometry

p1 + geom_point( )
p1 + geom_point(alpha = 0.5)

p1 <- p1 + geom_point(alpha = 0.5)

# Let's now look at linear models that use both 'x1' and 'x2'

# First of all let's plot x1, x2 and y together:

p <- ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = x2, colour = y), data = Data) + coord_equal()
p + geom_point( )
p + geom_point(size = 6)

p + geom_point(size = 6) + scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rev(heat.colors(n = 1e3)))

p + geom_point(size = 3) + scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rev(rainbow(start = 0, end = 0.7, n = 1e3)))
p + geom_point(size = 6, alpha = 0.25) + scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rev(rainbow(start = 0, end = 0.7, n = 1e3)))

# We've seen above the polynomial terms are useful for predicting y from the covariate x1
# Let's now create a dataframe containing polynomial terms up to order four for each covariate
# along with a linear interaction term:

X <- data.frame(x1 = Data$x1,
                x2 = Data$x2,
                x1.2 = Data$x1^2,
                x2.2 = Data$x2^2,
                x1.3 = Data$x1^3,
                x2.3 = Data$x2^3,
                x1.4 = Data$x1^4,
                x2.4 = Data$x2^4,
                x1x2 = Data$x1*Data$x2)

# Counting the intercept, there are 10 potential terms that could either be in
# or out of the model if we allow for polynomial terms to order four and a
# pairwise linear interaction term.
# Thus given the above full design matrix X we have

choose(10,2)

# potential different models we could fit and compare.
# With increasing number of covariate terms this number rapidly expands.

# A family of simple techniques for exploring such a potential model space
# (rather than fitting every single possible model and comparing them) is to
# employ a stepwise variable selection proceedure.
# Essentially what such techniques do is starting with either and empty
# (intercept only) model or a full (intercept plus all covariate terms) model
# the algorithm with sequentially add and remove covariate terms from the model
# until the improvement in some criteria from making further additions or
# deletions falls below some threshold amount, the available degrees of
# freedom are exhausted or an empty (intercept only) model is arrived at.
# A common and simple way to choose which covariates to add or remove at each
# step of the algorithm is to choose the addition or substraction of a covariate
# term that yield the best improvement in some information criterion (e.g. AIC,
# BIC, etc. ) relative to the current model and to halt when the improvement in
# this information criterion from subsequent additions or deletions of covariate
# terms is less than some threshold amount or a user specified maximum number of
# addition/deletion steps has been performed.

# The first step to prepare for such a search is to create model object to bound
# this search i.e. an intercept only model:

m1.lm = lm(Data$y ~ +1, data = X)
summary(m1.lm)

# and a full model containing an intercept and all the covariate terms:

m2.lm = lm(Data$y ~ ., data = X)
summary(m2.lm)

# Once we have these boundaries of the potential model space defined we are
# ready to commence our stepwise variable selection proceedure with the step( )
# function see ?step for details:

m.select <- step(object = m1.lm, scope = list(lower = m1.lm, upper = m2.lm), direction = 'both', steps = 1e5)

# step( ) prints out each step it takes in the model fitting and stores the
# returns the final model

m.select

# if you set direction = c('forward') only additions to the model are considered
# at each step i.e. you'd want to start with an empty model by setting
# object = m1.lm

m.fwrd.select <- step(object = m1.lm, scope = list(lower = m1.lm, upper = m2.lm), direction = 'forward', steps = 1e5)


# if direction = c('backward') only deletions from the model are considered
# at each step i.e. you'd want to start with a full model by setting
# object = m2.lm

m.bwrd.select <- step(object = m2.lm, scope = list(lower = m1.lm, upper = m2.lm), direction = 'backward', steps = 1e5)

# if direction = c('both') only additions or deletions from the model are
# considered at each step (where possible) so you can start with either a full
# model or and empty model or something inbetween:

m.fb.select <- step(object = m1.lm, scope = list(lower = m1.lm, upper = m2.lm), direction = 'both', steps = 1e5)

# We can compare the selected models by sorting the fitted covariates as follows
sort(coef(m.fwrd.select))
sort(coef(m.bwrd.select))
sort(coef(m.fb.select))

# Here we have the fortuitious situtaion of having arrived at the same model
# by each of these three searches so there is no need to choose between their
# results.  When forward, backwards and forward/backward variable selection
# searches yield different final models from the same full potential design
# matrix a simple way to choose between them is to choose the model with the
# overall best infromation criterion value if two (or more) models are almost
# identical in this regard this is worth reporting! (All model are at best
# approximations of the processes that produced the data).

m.select <- m.fb.select

# Next let's examine the diagnostic plots for the selected model

par(mfcol = c(2,2))
plot(m.select)
# (much improved)

# As we have two explanatory variables ('x1' and 'x2') and single response
# variable 'y' predictions from the selected model will form a surface in
# three dimensional space.
# A surface in three dimensional space be readily represented by a coloured
# two dimensional image where colour is proportional to the coordinate in the
# third dimension.
# To produce a plot of this predicted surface we create a regular grid of points
# on the x1 - x2 plane at which to evaluated the selected model:

Pred.at.df <- expand.grid(seq(from = min(X$x1), to = max(X$x1), length.out = 500),seq(from = min(X$x2), to = max(X$x2), length.out = 500))

head(Pred.at.df)
dim(Pred.at.df)

colnames(Pred.at.df) <- c('x1','x2')

# We then need to expand this set of points to include the polynomial terms and
# interaction term for each of the points in the grid

Pred.at.df.full <- data.frame(x1 = Pred.at.df$x1,
                x2 = Pred.at.df$x2,
                x1.2 = Pred.at.df$x1^2,
                x2.2 = Pred.at.df$x2^2,
                x1.3 = Pred.at.df$x1^3,
                x2.3 = Pred.at.df$x2^3,
                x1.4 = Pred.at.df$x1^4,
                x2.4 = Pred.at.df$x2^4,
                x1x2 = Pred.at.df$x1*Pred.at.df$x2)

# Equipped with this regular grid of covariate values we can then evalate the
# model at each of the points in the grid

y.hat <- predict(object = m.select, newdata = Pred.at.df.full)

# To plot the predictions we need them in a dataframe alongside the explanatory
# variable values from which they were calculated:

Prediction <- data.frame(y = y.hat, x1 = Pred.at.df.full$x1, x2 = Pred.at.df.full$x2)

p2 <- ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = x2, fill = y), data = Prediction) + coord_equal()
# the default colour scale is similar to a grey scale but for hues of blue:
p2 + geom_raster()
# often a grey scale image will be required by journals unless you wish to pay
# (a lot) for a colour graphic:
p2 + geom_raster() + scale_fill_gradientn(colours = grey(level = (1:1e4)/1e4))
# contour plots are also an addition
p2 + geom_raster()  + scale_fill_gradientn(colours = grey(level = (1:1e4)/1e4))+ geom_contour(aes(z = y), colour = 'white')
# a gradient from red through yellow to white is one popular choice if a colour
# scale is permissable
p2 + geom_raster() + scale_fill_gradientn(colours = heat.colors(n = 1e3))
# a rainbow colour gradient is another one popular choice if a colour scale is
# permissable bear in mind though you may have colourblind readers/audience
# members for whom such a colour scale will likely confound interpretation of
# your figure:
p2 + geom_raster() + scale_fill_gradientn(colours = rev(rainbow(n = 1e3, start = 0, end = 0.7)))
# terrain themed colours are another option
p2 + geom_raster() + scale_fill_gradientn(colours = terrain.colors(n = 1e4, alpha = 0.4))



# In order to depict the proximity of the predicted surface to the observed data
# we may plot the predicted values as a raster on the x1 - x2 plane with colour
# proportional to the predicted y values then superimpose on this plot points
# where the observed y value is proportional to the point colour.
# For this graphic to be most easily understood it is best to use the same
# colour scale and colour scale limits for the observed and predicted y values.

range(Data$y)
range(Prediction$y)

# Of the observed and predicted y values the observed y values has the most
# extreme values so we will use those to define the colour scale:

scale.limits = range(Data$y)

# 

# Please choose a colour scale that is intelligible to you and update the p2
# object to include the raster plot of the predicted y values that uses this
# colour scale e.g.

p2 <- p2 + geom_raster() + scale_fill_gradientn(colours = rev(rainbow(n = 1e3, start = 0, end = 0.7)), limits = scale.limits)

p2

# It will be useful if the coloured points representing the observations have
# black borders to differentiate them from the surrounding predicted values.
# One simple way to achieve this is to overlay black points with smaller
# coloured points:

p2 + geom_point(colour = 'black', size = 3, data = Data) + geom_point(aes(colour = y), size = 2, data = Data) + scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rev(rainbow(n = 1e3, start = 0, end = 0.7)), limits = scale.limits)

# To Convert the Frames into an Animation:
#    1) Open the first frame '1.png' with the GIMP
#       (GIMP = GNU Image Manipulation Program
#        www.gimp.org)
#    2) Use the GAP (GIMP Animation Package)
#       to covert the frames into a video.
#       (From the 'Video' menu select 'Master Video Encoder')
#       .avi is the default format.
#  
#    Note you may need to install the GAP add-on to the GIMP
#    or it may install by default (if you don't have a 'Video'
#    menu then you need to install the GAP.
